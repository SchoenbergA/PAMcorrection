\title{Corr_df2 - Automated correction of PAM using tuned mean for specified attributes.}
\usage{
Corr_df2(df, att1 = NULL, att2 = NULL, tuning = NULL, modef = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame - containing Control and PAM values with colnames "CTR" and "PAM"}

\item{att1}{character - Column name of data frame which should be used to correct by mean. If missing, will
use the global mean to correct PAM.}

\item{att2}{character - Additional column name of data frame which should be used to correct by mean.
Only necessary if the correction should use subgroups for the data in 'pos1'}

\item{tuning}{\itemize{
\item character - method for clipping the data used to calculate the mean. Either "whisker" or "quantil". If 'NULL' will perform no tuning. Default= NULL.
}}

\item{modef}{\itemize{
\item boolean - if TRUE uses factor correction, if FALSE uses absolute values. Default=TRUE.
}}
}
\value{
returns a data.frame with an additional column "PAM_corr" with the corrected PAM values
and prints the respective mean values for each class or combination of classes. Uses 'tuned' data to calculate the mean values.
}
\description{
uses the mean based on the data clipped by 'Whisker' and 'Quantil' for specified subgroups to correct the PAM values.
}
\details{
If a specific class or combination of attributes has no values left after tuning the mean will be calculated based on the original data. This will lead to a warning.
The class or combination is marked as 'keep' in the result table.
}
\note{
If used without any attributes will use the global mean over all values to correct PAM. IF 'att1' is set
will calculate the mean for each group in 'att1' to correct PAM. IF 'att2' is given will use the mean for each group
with the combination for each attribute.
}
\examples{
# load data
dat <- read.csv(system.file("extdata","exp_PAM.csv",package = "PAMcorrection"))
head(dat)

# correct df by means for "generation"
corrected <-Corr_df(dat,att1 = "generation")

# use two classes (means for each generation depending on dilect)
corrected <-Corr_df(dat,att1 = "generation",att2 = "dilect")

# use absolute values
corrected <-Corr_df(dat,att1 = "generation",modef = F)
corrected <-Corr_df(dat,att1 = "generation",att2 = "dilect",modef = F)
